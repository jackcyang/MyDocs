These are my vim configuration files.

"vimrc" is my vimrc file.
"gvimfullscreen.dll" is for gvim's fullscreen mode for Windows.

"vim-php-manual.tgz" is php manual files for vim.
Installation:
Create a folder named 'doc' somewhere and add this to your runtimepath.
For example unpack it to c:\program\vim\php\doc and add this to your .vimrc: runtimepath+=c:\program\vim\php
